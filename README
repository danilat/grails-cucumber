Status:
    Currently supports running cucumber features against your step definitions. Automatically 
    installs all needed JRuby support for cuke4duke. Adding "run-app" to the command line will startup 
    your Grails application prior to running any steps and will shut the app down when finished.


Installation
    $ grails install-plugin path/to/grails-cucumber-0.2.zip

Usage:
    $ grails cucumber [run-app]

    Place Cucumber Feature definitions in baseDir/features and groovy step 
    definitions in baseDir/features/step_definitions. Global Before and After 
    hooks can be placed in baseDir/features/support (in groovy files).

TODO:
    * move step definitions to test/cucumber/steps and provide them to cucumber using Spring.
    * provide better support for test reporting
    * consider integrating with a test running so it can be run like: "grails test-app :cucumber"
